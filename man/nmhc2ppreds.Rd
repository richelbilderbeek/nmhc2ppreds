\title{nmhc2ppreds: Lookup tables for netmhc2pan IC50 predictions}
\description{
We can predict how well a peptide binds to the presentation molecules
used by the immune system. This package allows to see how well a
molecule binds relatively.
}
\details{
The \code{netmhc2pan} R package can predict the
IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) of a peptide for an MHC-I haplotype.
A peptide that is strongly bound to the MHC molecules is in the
lower percentile, for example in the lowest 2% of all IC50s.
This package determines the threshold IC50 for all percentiles.

To be able to do so,
the IC50 predictions of 10k random peptides is measured
and the distribution at the percentile level is stored as a lookup table.
}
\examples{
# Get the IC50 value of which 2\% of IC50 predictions are below,
# that is, bind better to the MHC complexes
ic50_threshold <- get_ic50_threshold(
  peptide_length = 9,
  mhc_haplotype = "HLA-A-01:01",
  percentile = 0.02
)

# A IC50 value predicted by netmhc2pan
my_ic50 <- 100.0

if (my_ic50 < ic50_threshold) {
  message("This is a binder, as it is in the lowest 2\% of all IC50s")
}
